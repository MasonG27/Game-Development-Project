# Game Development Project Invicta
For the past few months I have developed a third person moba that encapsolates some of the progress I have made over the past 2 years of game design and development. This repo is the home of updates and progression on the project. Check out the Issues section to see what I have worked on thus far, as well as the Wiki tab for a dev blog type view! Lastly, in the projects tab presents a timeline that I followed closely while working on it as a final project in college and of course please feel free to leave feedback in the issues tab, thanks!
