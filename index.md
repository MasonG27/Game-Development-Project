<p>My project is broken up into 2 major parts, documentation and visual coding(scripting/blueprints) both played their own unique role in the development process of this project.</p>

<p>When it came to preparation I knew documentation was going to keep my project organized. Documentation is well practiced in the game industry, and I found that timelines, game design documents and developer notes are the three most important documents to keep track of.</p>
