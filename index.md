<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My project is broken up into 2 major parts, documentation and visual coding(scripting/blueprints) both played their own unique role in the development process of this project.</p>
<p>When it came to preparation I knew documentation was going to keep my project organized. Documentation is well practiced in the game industry, and I found that timelines, game design documents and developer notes are the three most important documents to keep track of.</p>

<p>Inspiration for this project was driven from Epic Games MOBA(multiplayer online battle arena) game Paragon, which was shut down for financial reasons and in doing so they also released all the assets for free on their game engine, Unreal. These assets are a perfect template for young game developers with limited skills because they provide all the triple A potential, you just need to figure out how to put the pieces(code) back together for things to function properly.</p>

<h2>Month 1 - Mapping the Environment</h2>

<p>Although I spent about 25% of my time on the length of the project on environment design, I believe it was a good idea because it allowed me to show my potential as an environment artist. Additionally, it shows professional design techniques since each lane, jungle path and camp had to be strategically placed in order to make sure each side was evenly matched. This was achieved by countless play testing, measuring and timing.</p>
