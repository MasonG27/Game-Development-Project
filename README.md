# Game Development Project - Invicta
For the past few months I have developed a third person moba that encapsolates some of the progress I have made over the past few years of game design and development. This repo is the home of updates and progression on the project. Check out the Issues section to see what I have worked on thus far, as well as the Wiki tab for a dev blog type view! Lastly, in the projects tab presents a timeline that I followed closely while working on it as a final project in college and of course please feel free to leave feedback in the issues tab, thanks!
